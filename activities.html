        <br> Online Hospital System Design which can make the communication between Patients and Doctors easier. It is an IT based work which can contribute a lot in making medical services efficient.
        <br>Useful Medical data extraction using Computer Vision and AI. Generally processing medical image to extract useful information. For example, count the total number of cells from a microscope image.
        <br> Emergency Medical response system which is designed to provide emergency medical services like an ambulance with reduced delay.
        <br> Computer program development to test an individual’s hearing ability.
        <br> Our members worked/working on some projects involving electrical circuits, logic designs and robotics.
        Examples are: Acquiring biological signals, controlling motor with gyroscopic sensor (can be used to control wheelchairs or help paralyzed patients), prosthetic arm, smart wheelchair.
        <br>Algorithm development for convolution (using Matlab). Convolution is widely used in signal processing.

            Those are some of the project based activities we worked on/currently working on.<br>

Other than those we also hold discussions where we talk about ideas. The purpose is to share ideas, skills and knowledge. Any member can learn about his/her favorite topic by discussing it with any other person holding the same interests. Instead of organizing classes, we believe this approach of directly involving in project brainstorming and collaboration aids an individual to work on/ learn about his/her exact interests. Classes conducted by experts are organized for topics preferred by numerous members.
<br>
We aim to prepare our club members for future obstacles which they might encounter in their professional life. Situations like job interviews, board meetings, business meetings, meetings about marketing or project, and others. Through participation in our club activities, members can learn how well they perform or improve their performances.
